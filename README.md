# F1 Race Stastical Analysis 2009-2024 

This project aims to analyze and visualize Formula 1 race data from 2009 to 2024, focusing on various aspects such as driver performance, team performance, and specific race events..

**Dataset:**
* Name: Formula 1 Race Data
* Source: Kaggle
* Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtrotman/formula-1-race-data

**Data Preprocessing:**
* Handled missing values
* Converted categorical variables to numerical
* Converted recorded laptimes times to seconds
* Feature scaling
* Multiple CSV files were merged to make new related information
* Filtered data to focus on relevant years (2009-2024) and specific drivers or teams of interest.

**Analysis Framework:**
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Utilized pandas for efficient data manipulation and management
* Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn


**Analysis:**
* Visualized fastest lap times, highest ranks, and performance trends for drivers and teams.
* Identified Lando Norris's fastest lap times and highest positions each year.
* Analyzed Miami Grand Prix fastest laps from 2021-2024.
* Evaluated team and driver points performance for the 2023 season.
* Determined drivers with most pole positions and wins without pole positions in 2023.
* Checked consistency of driver performance in 2023 and analyzed the relationship between qualifying and final race positions.
* Distribution of points and wins for specific drivers over the years.
* Driver with the most pole positions and wins in 2023. (DUDUDDU MAX VERSTAPPEN)
* Driver with most wins without pole in 2023. (DUDUDDU MAX VERSTAPPEN)

**Limitations:**
* Dataset might not be representative of core factors such as engine,power,tires age etc.
* Core accuracy could be improved with additional factors.
* The analysis focused on specific years and drivers, potentially overlooking broader trends.

**Potential Developments:**
* Incorporate external factors such as weather conditions, track characteristics, and car specifications into the analysis.
* Develop interactive dashboards for better data exploration and visualization.
* Conduct more detailed comparisons between drivers across different eras and teams.

**Visualisation:**
* The project uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various plots, such as bar plots, line plots, heatmaps, and density plots, to visualize the data and derive insights.
